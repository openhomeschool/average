# The "average" project
## openhome.school Computer Class

This project is just a container for student code, and some test data.
Students are to write code within the defined (but empty) average() method, to compute the average of the numbers sent.

## Details


You may want to use some of these...

```python
my_list = [4, 6]    # this creates a list with two items in it: 'hi' and 'bye'
4 + 6               # this returns 10, as you might expect

total = 4 + 6
total = total + 8
total += 10         # another way to say total = total + 10

```
